Hello! Iâ€™m Patty, a second year PhD student in Computer Science at Princeton University the [Center for Information Technology Policy (CITP)](https://citp.princeton.edu) advised by Prof. [Peter Henderson](https://www.peterhenderson.co). I am interested in the ethics of algorithmic systems in assisting decisionmaking, both in understanding the impacts of these systems on society and in building systems that align with specific groups' needs.  

Before Princeton, I graduated with a BASc in Engineering Science Machine Intelligence from the University of Toronto in 2024. I interned at the Vector Institute advised by Prof. [Nicolas Papernot](https://www.papernot.fr) and Prof. [Rahul G. Krishnan](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rahulgk/). I worked on topics related to fairness and privacy in Machine Learning, as well as Machine Learning applications in healthcare.
